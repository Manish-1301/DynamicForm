#DYNAMICFORM

### THE API that serves the json file for the dynamicform is available at https://github.com/Manish-1301/models. I would highly recommend you to go through it to understand how the form works. I have also uploaded a copy of the models.json in the src folder

##### STEP 1- RUN NPM INSTALL
#### STEP2- RUN npm START

#### NOTE- IT WILL ONLY WORK WITH THE API. SO YOU FIRST NEED TO GO TO https://github.com/Manish-1301/models

#### IN THIS DYNAMICFORM THE CITY IS DEPENDENT AND CHANGES ACCORDING TO THE STATE
